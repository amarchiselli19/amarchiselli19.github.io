                  <p>Growing up my father and grandfather taught me how to work with my hands and complete home improvement tasks around the house. I was taught how to use simple tools like hammer and tape measure to complex tools like a jointer and table router.Some home improvent projects I aided in was remodeling our kitchen, rebuilding a cedar closet, and repainting and flooring 3 bedrooms. My favorite thing to do is using spackle to fill in holes in the walls.</p>
